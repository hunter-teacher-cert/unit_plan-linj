# An Introduction to Java GUIs
by Jenna Lin, Jihae Park, Joel Bianchi

-----

### General Overview
Course: AP Computer Science A

In this post AP Exam unit, students will learn how to develope a 2D Platformer Game, a 2D Tile-Based Game or an Educational App Game using the Processing IDE. 

---

### Motivation for Unit
We would like to plan something fun and engaging after the AP Exam. Gauging from our previous teaching experiences, student engagement is often high when games are involved in the classroom. Moreover, game design is a useeful context for developing computational thinking and digital creativity. This would provide students with an authentic context for learning. Students cam make their own chocies, find solutions to problems, and lead the design process. We also want to expose our students to a different programming language, Processing and collaborative coding environment with version controls (via Github).
