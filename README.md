# An Introduction to Java GUIs
by Jenna Lin, Jihae Park, Joel Bianchi

-----

### General Overview
Course: AP Computer Science A

In this post AP Exam unit, students will learn how to develope a 2D Platformer Game, a 2D Tile-Based Game or an Educational App Game using the Processing IDE. GUIs are one of the most important parts of any web application. Unlike a text-based interface where users have to type commands into a command line box to tell the computer what to do, a GUI makes it easier for them to input commands by creating visual cues that are more relatable and standardized across all devices.

### Motivation for Unit
We would like to plan something fun and engaging after the AP Exam. It would be a nice challenge for the students because it requires mastery of basic Java programming. We want to expose our students to professional Java tools including a Java game framework(Litiengine) and collaborative coding environment with version controls (via Github).
