### General Overview
Course: AP Computer Science A

In this post AP Exam unit, students will learn how to develope a 2D Platformer Game, a 2D Tile-Based Game or an Educational App Game using the Processing IDE. Students will be guided through the development of a 2D Tile-Based Game, TicTacToe, using Processing. The main objectives of this unit is to promote collaboration between students and prepare students to work in teams; and to help students develop creativity and individuality in problem solving and performing tasks.

### Motivation for Unit
We would like to plan something fun and engaging after the AP Exam. Gauging from our previous teaching experiences, student engagement is often high when games are involved in the classroom. Moreover, game design is a useeful context for developing computational thinking and digital creativity. This would provide students with an authentic context for learning. Students cam make their own chocies, find solutions to problems, and lead the design process. We also want to expose our students to a different programming language, Processing and collaborative coding environment with version controls (via Github).

### Standards Referenced
9-12.CT.4 (Abstraction and Decomposition)
Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the
computation

9-12.CT.8 (Algorithms and Programming)
Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for
practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

### Tools Used
- Processing.org - Java-based code to help with graphics
- Visual Studio Code - IDE for developing
- Github - for code sharing version control
